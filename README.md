## About

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a weather app that allows users to enter a city name and receive the current temperature, weather, humidity, wind speed, etc.

This app makes use of the Open Weather Map API: (https://api.openweathermap.org/).
